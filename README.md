# Starwars Blog Reading List

This project is part of the 4Geeks Academy Full Stack program, where a minimalistic version of the Star Wars database is created with a "Read Later" or "Favorites" list functionality.

A web app is created with React that lists the people and planet entities provided by an external API called SWAPI.
